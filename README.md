I have created a comprehensive website where users can explore a vast list of international cricket teams and access detailed player statistics. The homepage presents users with a list of international teams, and upon selecting a team, users can view the players associated with that team. The player list provides convenient search functionality, enabling users to find specific players by name and filter them based on their role.

To delve into a player's statistics, simply click on their player card. This action reveals the player's basic information, along with their batting and bowling statistics. Users can access valuable insights such as runs scored, average, strike rate, wickets taken, bowling average, economy rate, and other relevant metrics. The player card serves as a comprehensive overview of the player's performance in both batting and bowling aspects of the game.

In addition to the cricket data, I have also implemented user login and registration features, making it mandatory for users to log in to access the website. This enables a personalized experience and allows users to unlock additional features and functionalities. By leveraging React.js and Redux, I have built a robust and efficient front-end, while Vercel hosts the front-end for seamless deployment and live updates.

On the back-end, I have utilized Node.js and Express.js to build the server, providing the necessary APIs for data retrieval and storage. MongoDB serves as the database management system, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval of player information and statistics. The back-end is hosted using Render, providing a reliable hosting solution for the server.

For those interested, the source code for the front-end can be found at: https://github.com/iambunty45/cricket-player-info-frontend.git
, while the source code for the back-end can be found at: https://github.com/iambunty45/cricket-player-info-backend.git.

Feel free to explore the live demo of the website, accessible at: https://cricket-player-info-frontend-vbd3.vercel.app. The user login and registration features enhance the user experience and allow for a more personalized interaction with the website.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out. Enjoy exploring the website and discovering the fascinating world of international cricket!
